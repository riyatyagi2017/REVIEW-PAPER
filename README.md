# REVIEW-PAPER
## ABSTRACT:

Data is usually incorrect. The topic of categorization with insufficient data is novel. This study 
provides a categorization for partial survey data. The process of classification using incomplete 
data is complex, and its effectiveness is decided by the technique employed to deal with missing 
data. Missing data occurs when no data value for an attribute or feature in a dataset is retained. 
This study provides a high-level overview of incomplete data handling methodologies and 
analyses the various classification and missing data strategies. It presents a number of 
classification techniques that take advantage of incomplete data.
